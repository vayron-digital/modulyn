## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Master Script (Recommended)
1. Open your Supabase project dashboard
2. Go to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `11_master_script.sql`
4. Run the script

### Option 2: Individual Scripts
1. Run scripts in numerical order (01 through 10)
2. Each script can be run independently
3. Some scripts depend on previous ones, so order matters

- **Permission System**: Granular permissions for each feature
- **Audit Trail**: Activity logging for compliance

## üîê Authentication Integration

The database is designed to work with Supabase Auth and Google OAuth:
- Uses existing `auth.users` table
- Profiles table extends user information
- RLS policies use `auth.uid()` for user identification
- Tenant isolation through `auth.jwt()` claims

## üìä Sample Data

The sample data includes:
- 1 subscription (Professional tier)
- 3 events (conference, workshop, networking)
- 3 contacts (customer, prospect, lead)
- 3 leads with different scores and stages
- 3 deals in various pipeline stages
- 3 properties (office, warehouse, retail)
- 3 tasks with different priorities
- Email templates and notifications
- Dashboard widgets and KPI definitions

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

### Adding New Features
1. Create new tables in appropriate script files
2. Add RLS policies for security
3. Create utility functions if needed
4. Update sample data for testing

### Modifying Existing Features
1. Update table schemas in core scripts
2. Modify RLS policies for new columns
3. Update functions and triggers
4. Regenerate sample data if needed

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Permission Errors**: Ensure RLS policies are correctly applied
2. **Foreign Key Errors**: Check that referenced tables exist
3. **Enum Errors**: Verify enum types are created before use
4. **Function Errors**: Ensure utility functions are created before triggers

### Debugging
1. Check Supabase logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify table creation order in scripts
3. Test RLS policies with different user roles
4. Use Supabase dashboard to inspect table structure

## üìà Performance Considerations

- All tables include appropriate indexes
- RLS policies are optimized for performance
- Large tables use partitioning strategies
- Analytics data has automatic cleanup jobs

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Monitor subscription limits
- Clean up expired data (automated)
- Review and update RLS policies
- Backup important data

### Updates
- Test scripts in development environment first
- Use migrations for production changes
- Document all schema changes
- Update sample data as needed
